## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Hackathon-Idea-2
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. **Start the development servers**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start:

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to start services individually:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Frontend (in another terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## üìä Demo Data

The application includes realistic fake data for demonstration:

### Lymphoma Cases (6 sample cases)
- **Hodgkin Lymphoma**: 2 cases with different age groups and treatments
- **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma**: 4 cases covering DLBCL, Burkitt, Follicular, and Mantle Cell
- **Genomic Data**: Realistic mutations and translocations
- **Treatments**: Standard protocols (ABVD, R-CHOP, intensive regimens)
- **Outcomes**: Complete remission, partial remission, stable disease

### Expert Network (6 sample experts)
- Verified specialists from major cancer centers
- Different specialties and regions
- Availability status and ratings

## üîê Login Credentials (Demo)

Use any of these combinations to test the application:

```
Medical ID: MD123456
Hospital: Johns Hopkins Hospital
Region: United States - Northeast
Password: demo123
```

```
Medical ID: DOC789012
Hospital: Mayo Clinic  
Region: United States - Midwest
Password: demo123
```

The verification system simulates real-world medical directory integration.
